/*
Sort the given unsorted array 'arr' of size 'N' in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm.


 Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. 


Example:
Input:
N = 5
arr = {8, 6, 2, 5, 1}

Output:
1 2 5 6 8 
Explanation: add-image

Input format :
First line contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
Output format :
The output contains the integers of the sorted array, separated by a single space.
Note:-
You donâ€™t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.
Sample Input 1:
6
2 13 4 1 3 6 
Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 6 13 
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
 Select 1 and swap with element at index 0. arr= {1,13,4,2,3,6}

 Select 2 and swap with element at index 1. arr= {1,2,4,13,3,6}

 Select 3 and swap with element at index 2. arr= {1,2,3,13,4,6}

 Select 4 and swap with element at index 3. arr= {1,2,3,4,13,6}

 Select 6 and swap with element at index 4. arr= {1,2,3,4,6,13}
Sample Input 2:
5
9 3 6 2 0
Sample Output 2:
0 2 3 6 9
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
